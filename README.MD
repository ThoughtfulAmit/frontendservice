This file is for Capstone project for DevOps bootcamp. This is just a simple NodeJS front end application displaying the values
from a backend Weather Microservice written in C#.
The backend microservice runs on port 5000.

http://localhost:5000/weatherforecast

This returns random weather data - date, temperature in celsius, temperate in fahrenheit and a summary description.

The returned JSON is shown in the NodeJS webapp in bootstrap theme UI in cards.
